The simplest way to [install jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html) notebooks is by installing [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/), a custom python distribution and packagemanager used for Data Science.

You can use the command `conda create --name \"MyEnvironmentName\" python=3.12.1 ipython` to create a new conda environment. Once your environment is created you can activate it using the command `conda activate MyEnvironmentName`. Your command line should now look like `(MyEnvironmentName) [user@pc]`. Python now has access only to the packages installed in your conda environment. We recommend making a environment for each assignment.  \n",

        "\n",
        "If you do not want to install all of anaconda you can also install jupyter via pip: ``pip3 install jupyter`` and use the command `Jupyter notebook` in your terminal.

Since we built this dataframe from integers, that's what it says there. Other datatypes are for example floats, datetime and object. Remember that since pandas uses numpy under the hood, everything in one column has to be the same datatype. If there are in fact things with different datatypes in a column, then pandas uses the super-broad datatype \"object\" that can fit any of the other datatypes. So if you see \"object\" as a datatype in this function, you might have to do some more data preprocessing."

        "\n",
        "The notation for using loc uses either `.loc[row labels]` as style when we're only selecting some rows,  `.loc[:, column labels]` when we only want to select columns, or `.loc[rows, columns]` when we want to select both.\n",
        "\n",
        "One pitfall when using `.loc` to access a slice, like `.loc['col1':'col3']`, is that the selection *includes* the last element, so you'd get three columns this way. This makes it different from most other slice notation in Python."

Likewise, if you're working together with people, it's easier if you understand what others are doing. Adhering (sensibly) to PEP8 makes this easy.\n",

Particularly good ones for Python are PyCharm (by Jetbrains) and Visual Studio Code (by Microsoft). Both have free versions available, and if you register for a student version you generally get the full features. There is also plenty of information on the internet on how to use them. Typically just googling on \"product name\" + \"thing you want to do\" will get you in the right direction."

        "## Python environments\n",
        "When you start working on more than one project in Python, it can be useful to arrange for separate environments for them. This can be useful or necessary for several reasons:\n",
        "* Because some package in project A requires an older version of a package Q, while in project B you need a newer version of package Q.\n",
        "* Because you want to be able to copy your project to a different computer, and it should work the same way there as it does on your primary computer. (Like when we have to grade it...)\n",
        "\n",
        "If you just install every package user-wide or even system-wide on your computer, that can make it hard to determine what exactly you're using for *this particular project* and what someone would need to install to run your project. This is bad in science, because we want to be able to reproduce experiments. But it's also bad in industry, because you want to be sure that when you develop code in a development environment, that it'll work the same way in the production environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Luckily, there are solutions. Less luckily, there are multiple solutions which can get confusing. Teaching each of these goes beyond the scope of this tutorial but you should be at least familiar with the names:\n",
        "* The Anaconda distribution of Python has the `conda` program to create environments with. These can be exported into a `environment.yml` file, and with this file someone else can re-recreate your environment. You would mostly use the `conda` program to install new packages into this environment. Anaconda comes with most scientific packages for Python already installed, which can make it a bit heavy but also very batteries-included.\n",
        "* Outside the Anaconda world, people mostly use `pip` to install packages. You can also first set up a *virtual environment* with either `virtualenv` or `venv` (the latter is newer but less widely adopted). Using `pip` you can \"freeze\" an environment and export it to a `requirements.txt` file. With the requirements file you can then initialize a new environment with the same packages.\n",
        "* You can also use Google Colab, which is a cloud-based version of Jupyter Notebook with some version control, commenting and collaboration tools added to it. Since it's in the cloud, you can also alter that environment without worrying that it affects your own computer. Like Anaconda, it has a lot of packages already installed, although you can use `pip` to install more as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "When explaining what `conda` and `pip` do, it's roughly like this: `conda` installs just about anything, including non-Python software, into an Anaconda environment. Meanwhile `pip` installs only Python packages, into any kind of environment, including Anaconda.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although we aim for all assignments in this course to be *possible* on Colab, you should investigate which kind of virtual environment you want to use on your own computer and do some tutorials on it, because you'll be able to get better performance from running locally.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Good package importing practices\n",
        "It's quite common in tutorials that you see packages only imported at the moment they're about to be used. In a Jupyter notebook this can be many cells down. This is of course useful for focusing your attention on them. However, it also has a downside; you can't easily look at a file and see what packages you need to run it. And in the case of a notebook, if you're executing cells out of sequence because you're trying to debug something, you often find you need to hunt back and forth to import everything you need.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's therefore good practice to put one cell near the very top of your notebook with all the package imports you need. You can see an example at the top of this notebook."

        "This lab only covers the beginnings of these packages. You can find a lot more information on the internet; these packages are widely used and well-documented. Good places to look are:\n",
        "* The official documentation. Just googling for something like `numpy.random`, or a specific function like \"numpy random uniform\" will turn up the relevant page.\n",
        "* There are many tutorials available for doing specific things with each of these packages. Again, just searching the internet will usually turn up something.\n",

        "\n",
        "As you get more experienced you'll probably start learning more on the official documentation to look up a precise detail, than on tutorials. Although if you're starting a project that uses a technique you haven't used yet, it's good to just read up a bit on it. This software is quite friendly to self-study because there's so much good material on the web."

Keep in mind that we will ask questions related to the coding and theoretical concepts covered in your assignments during the exam/resit.\n",
